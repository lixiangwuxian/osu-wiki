# User title

A **user title** is a short label on a user's profile page set by the [osu!team](/wiki/People/The_Team). Most titles indicate membership of a [user group](/wiki/People/The_Team#user-groups), but some users have earned [more unique titles](/wiki/People/Users_with_unique_titles) for specific achievements or contributions.

The colour of a user title is the same as the user's colour, which is also usually set by group membership. If the user has no colour set, the title is white.

## History

### Post count titles

On the forum sections of the [old osu! website](https://old.ppy.sh)<!-- TODO: wiki page -->, users could obtain titles by reaching certain post count milestones. These were only shown on the sidebars of forum posts, not the users' profiles, and were not shown if a custom title was already set.

<!-- TODO: list all of the titles and their requirements -->

## Trivia

- User titles are referred to as "rank titles" throughout the game's code. This is a leftover name from when osu! was built on top of [phpBB](https://www.phpbb.com/).
