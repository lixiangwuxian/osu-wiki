# Geki

*See also: [Katu](/wiki/Katu)*

**Geki (æ¿€)**, or *Elite Beat!*, is a [scoring](/wiki/Score) term used when a player has completed a comboset with the highest possible [accuracy](/wiki/Gameplay/Accuracy) on every note. This idea originates from the Nintendo DS game Elite Beat Agents in which the [osu!standard](/wiki/Game_mode/osu!) [game mode](/wiki/Game_mode) is based on.
