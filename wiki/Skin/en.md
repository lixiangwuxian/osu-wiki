# Skin

*See also: [Skinning](/wiki/Skinning)*\
*For the dedicated sub-forum for skins, see [Skinning](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/15)*

A **skin** is a set of graphics (images) and custom sample sets (audio clips) that replace the default ones used by osu!. Many players regularly engage in the use of skins to allow for a more customised user experience, should they dislike the default skin. Almost all of what is visible or audible in osu! can be "skinned."
