# Accuracy

<!-- TODO: needs to be combined with /wiki/Accuracy in some way -->

**Accuracy** (or *acc* for short) defines how accurately a player is hitting [hit objects](/wiki/Hit_object) on a [beatmap](/wiki/Beatmap). This value varies from 0 to 100%. Accuracy can be seen in the top-right corner of the screen while watching a replay or playing a beatmap.
