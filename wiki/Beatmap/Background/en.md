# Background

*For regulations surrounding backgrounds, see: [Ranking Criteria](/wiki/Ranking_Criteria)*

**Background** (***BG***) images and videos can be added to [beatmaps](/wiki/Beatmap). When written only as "background" or "bg", it usually refers to the background image.

Backgrounds are displayed on beatmap cards, on the [song selection screen](/wiki/Interface#song-selection-screen), and during gameplay.
