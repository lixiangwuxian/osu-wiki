# Katu

*See also: [Geki](/wiki/Geki)*

**Katu (Âñù)**, *Katsu*, or *Beat!*, is a [scoring](/wiki/Score) term used when a player has completed a comboset without achieving the highest possible [accuracy](/wiki/Gameplay/Accuracy) on every note. This idea originates from the Nintendo DS game Elite Beat Agents which is one of the games the [osu!standard](/wiki/Game_mode/osu!) [game mode](/wiki/Game_mode) is based on.
