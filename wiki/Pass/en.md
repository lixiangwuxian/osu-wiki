# Pass

A **pass** describes the completion of a [beatmap](/wiki/Beatmap) or a certain beatmap section without the use of fail-preventing [mods](/wiki/Game_modifier) (e.g. [No Fail](/wiki/Game_modifier/No_Fail)), or getting to the break section with more than 50% [health](/wiki/Beatmapping/Health). In the case of reaching a break section, an indicator will display with sound to show that the player has passed the previous section.
