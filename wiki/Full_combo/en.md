# Full combo

**Full combo** (or *FC* for short) is a term used to describe a player obtaining the maximum possible combo<!-- TODO: link --> on a [beatmap](/wiki/Beatmap). Full combos are scored by passing a beatmap with no misses<!-- TODO: link -->, [sliderbreaks](/wiki/Gameplay/Slider_break), or dropped [slider ends](/wiki/Hit_object/Slidertail).

Scores that lost combo only via dropped slider ends are widely considered by the community to be full combos. This differs from the game client and website's display.

Due to the [combo multiplier effect](/wiki/Glossary/Combo_multiplier_effect), full combos will award the most [score](/wiki/Score) in the [osu!standard](/wiki/Game_mode/osu!), [osu!taiko](/wiki/Game_mode/osu!taiko), and [osu!catch](/wiki/Game_mode/osu!catch) [game modes](/wiki/Game_mode).
