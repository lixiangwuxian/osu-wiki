# Universal offset

*For other uses, see [Offset (disambiguation)](/wiki/Disambiguation/Offset).*

**Universal offset** is the audio offset [option](/wiki/Options) that applies to all songs in the osu! client. Setting it to a value other than `0` changes adds a delay between the currently playing song and the other sounds and graphics associated with it.

Each player's optimal universal offset value differs due to variations in their systems. An incorrectly determined universal offset will cause significant timing problems on all [beatmaps](/wiki/Beatmap).
