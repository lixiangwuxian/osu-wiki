# Project Loved Team

The **Project Loved Team** are members of the osu! community who manage [Project Loved](/wiki/Project_Loved), the voting platform that promotes [beatmaps](/wiki/Beatmap) to the [Loved](/wiki/Beatmap/Category#loved) category.

## Roles and responsibilities

The Project Loved Team mostly consists of *captains* for each [game mode](/wiki/Game_mode). Captains are responsible for nominating beatmaps to the Loved category and act as representatives for the community in having a good sense of which maps to choose. They also write short descriptions about the nominated maps to help readers get a feel for each map in case they have not seen or played them before.

The rest of the team helps with quality control, maintenance, and organisation.

## Team members

<!-- TODO: should probably document old team members, since they aren't credited anywhere, besides Toy in Trivia -->

![][flag_US] **[clayton](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3666350)** oversees the project and writes news and forum posts, ![][flag_LT] [huu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6044237) maintains the public spreadsheets and helps moderate discussions about Loved, and ![][flag_US] [Noffy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1541323), ![][flag_GB] [hypercyte](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9155377), and ![][flag_US] [eiri-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3388410) check metadata of beatmaps that will go up for voting. The rest of the team are captains:

## Trivia

- ![][flag_US] [Toy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2757689) created the original team of captains in September 2017 along with the [Captain's Pick](/wiki/Beatmap/History_of_Loved#captain's-pick-and-project-loved-(sep-2017-â€“-present)) system that was later renamed to Project Loved. Until late 2019, he oversaw and managed the whole project.
- There is a Project Loved user group on the website with group ID 31, but the listing is not public. It is used for permissions to moderate the [Project Loved forum](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/120) and promote beatmaps to the Loved category, and the only members are ![][flag_US] [clayton](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3666350), ![][flag_LT] [huu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6044237), and ![][flag_US] [Toy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2757689).
