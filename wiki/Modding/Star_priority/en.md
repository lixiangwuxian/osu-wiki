### Star priority

Star priority has two meanings:

1. A method of helping Beatmap Nominators to find beatmaps worthy of bubbling and later ranking.
   - The star priority of a beatmap is determined by how many mod posts that have gained kudosu in the beatmap's thread, the sum of kudosu stars the map set has received.
   - A kudosu star can be given by any user to any beatmap, though shooting a kudosu star comes at the price of one kudosu.
   - The conversion rate was formerly three kudosu for one kudosu star that increased the Star Priority by two.
   - The higher the star priority, the higher the beatmap's thread appears in the Works in Progress or Pending subforum.
   - At least 12 star priority is needed for a beatmap to be bubbled or ranked.
2. A method in determining whether a Feature Request is wanted by the community.
   - The higher the star priority, the faster it gets noticed.
   - Users that have supporter status active when voting will shoot a pink star (![Kudosu](/wiki/shared/Kudos.png)) that increases Star Priority by 2 each, whilst a user without supporter will shoot a blue star (![Star](/wiki/shared/icon/star.gif)) that is worth only 1 each. Users may be able to shoot multiple stars depending on how many votes they have left.
