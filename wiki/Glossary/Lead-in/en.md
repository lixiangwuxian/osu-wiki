# Lead-in

*See also: [Offset (disambiguation)](/wiki/Disambiguation/Offset)*

The **lead-in** is a three second period of silence that is occasionally inserted at the beginning of a [beatmap](/wiki/Beatmap). This is done to give players time to react to incoming [hit objects](/wiki/Hit_object) if a creator has placed them close to the start of the song.
