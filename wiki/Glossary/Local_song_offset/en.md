# Local song offset

*For offset while beatmapping, see: [Offset](/wiki/Beatmapping/Offset)*

**Local song offset** is an offset which moves the appearance of [hit objects](/wiki/Hit_object) in relation to the audio of individual [beatmaps](/wiki/Beatmap). This can be helpful for players who experience auditory or visual delays. Local song offset works alongside the global offset to calculate a total offset.

At the start of gameplay, the local song offset can be changed by pressing:

- `+` to increase the offset by 5 milliseconds
- `-` to decrease the offset by 5 milliseconds
- `Alt` + `+` to increase the offset by 1 milliseconds
- `Alt` + `-` to decrease the offset by 1 milliseconds

If a local offset is defined, osu! will display the local offset in the interface above the scoreboard<!-- TODO: add image of the local offset in the interface -->. osu! will also notify you of the local offset before starting gameplay.
