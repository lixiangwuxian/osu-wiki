# Choke

A term used when a player almost obtains a full combo while playing a [beatmap](/wiki/Beatmap), but [combobreaks](/wiki/Glossary/Combobreak) near the end. On the contrary, a reverse choke is when a player combobreaks at the beginning but holds combo throughout the rest of the beatmap.

The term is also used by many other online communities to describe the same or similar events and actions. (E.g., *Super Smash Bros.* and *speedrunners*)
