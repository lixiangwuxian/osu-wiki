# Loved

*See also: [Project Loved](/wiki/Project_Loved) and [Beatmaps ยง Loved](/wiki/Beatmap/Category#loved)*

**Loved** is a state given to [beatmaps](/wiki/Beatmap) that do not follow the [ranking criteria](/wiki/Ranking_Criteria), but are considered popular enough to deserve their own leaderboards. Loved beatmaps contribute to a user's total playcount, but does not gain them any [performance points](/wiki/Performance_points). All scores on a Loved beatmap will be deleted if it moves out of the Loved category. This usually only happens upon the creator's request.

Loved beatmaps use the heart icon ![](/wiki/shared/status/loved.png) in the song selection screen, and are regularly added through Project Loved which is handled by the [Project Loved Team](/wiki/People/The_Team/Project_Loved_Team).
