# Offset

*For other uses, see [Offset (disambiguation)](/wiki/Disambiguation/Offset).*

A [beatmap](/wiki/Beatmap)'s **offset** is the amount of time between the start of the audio file and the song's first downbeat measured in milliseconds. Offset is used to determine a beatmap's [timing](/wiki/Beatmap_Editor/Timing), alongside [beats per minute (BPM)](/wiki/Beatmapping/Beats_per_minute) and [meter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre_(music)).

Videos included with [beatmapsets](/wiki/Beatmap/Beatmapsets) also have offsets that can be set similarly to song offsets.
