# Song compilation

A **song compilation** is a collection of songs, usually sharing a genre, artist, or other theme.

[Beatmaps](/wiki/Beatmap) of song compilations use a single audio file that contains the whole collection of songs, usually including only a single chorus or verse of each. This is not to be confused with a [beatmapset](/wiki/Beatmap/Beatmapsets) that includes multiple song files in its folder.
