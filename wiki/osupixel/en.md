# osupixel

**osupixels** are one of the main coordinate systems used in osu! and apply to all [hit object](/wiki/Hit_object) placements and storyboard coordinates. The size of an osu!pixel changes depending on the currently selected resolution, but is equivalent to a pixel when osu! is running in 640x480 resolution. This scaling ensures a fair gameplay experience for all players.

Scaling is applied to the main coordinate system which is used for [osu! gameplay](/wiki/Gameplay). In contrast, textures are scaled such that one [texture pixel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texel_%28graphics%29) corresponds to one screen pixel at 1024x768 resolution.
